<h1>Pale Moon for Linux</h1>

<p>Pale Moon is an Open Source, Goanna-based web browser completely built from its own, independently developed source that has been forked off from Firefox/Mozilla code a number of years ago, and focuses on efficiency and ease of use by carefully selecting features and optimizations to improve the browser's stability and user experience, while offering full customization and a growing collection of <a href="//addons.palemoon.org/" target="_blank">extensions</a> and <a href="//addons.palemoon.org/themes/" target="_blank">themes</a> to make the browser truly your own.<br>
<br>
Pale Moon aims to provide close adherence to official web standards and specifications in its implementation (with minimal compromise), and purposefully excludes a number of features to strike a good balance between general use, performance, and technical advancements on the Web.<br>
<br>
With the current generation of mainstream browsers, there are also more obvious and not just "under the hood" differences: Pale Moon will continue to provide grouped navigation buttons of a decent size, a bookmarks toolbar that is enabled by default, tabs next to page content by default (easily switchable) and not in the least a functional status bar and more freedom in customization, to name a few things.<br>
